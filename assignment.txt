1.what is rework in software development?
a)Rework means reimplementing the process that was wrongly implemented at the first phase is called rework in the software development.And in the rework phase only we  fix bugs.
-----------------------
2.Differences between verification and validation ?
a)verification:
1.it includes checking document,design,code
2.verification is the static testing
3.it does not include the execution of code
4.it can find the bugs in the early stage of development
5.quality assurance team does verification
6.the goal of verification is application and software,architecture,specifications
b)validation:
1.it includes testing validiating the product
2.validation is dynamic testing
3.it includes the execution of code
4.it can only find the bugs that could not be found by the verification process.
5.validation is executed on software code with the help of testing team
6.the goal of validation is an actual product
--------------------------
3.evolutionary (prototyple model)
a)This model is built for demonstration purposes or as part of the development process
-in this process the specification and devdelopment phases are interleaved 
-the evolutionary model is produced and refined through a number of stages to final output
------------------------------------
4.RTM
a)it is document that demonstartes the relationship between requriments and other artifacts 
-it is used to prove that requriments have been fulfilled
-there are 5 requriments traceability matrix they are:
>business requriments
>srs
>project requriments
>use case document
>defect verification document
>user stories
------------------------
5.CODING STANDARDS:
a)a coding standard gives a uniform apperence to the code written by different engineers
-it improves readability,maintainability of the code and it reduces the complexity
-it is mainly used detect the errors from code.
